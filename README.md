# Talks I've given

This is the development branch of the repository of my talks.

## Structure

Each presentation gets its own repository branch (and, if necessary, it gets separate "dev" and "deploy" branches). This allows for CI (i.e. deployment) to be done independently for each talk, and also makes embedding talks into other repositories (e.g. my personal website) easier.

The main "dev" branch (i.e. the one containing this README) is used to provide an overview of the dev-versions of each talk.
